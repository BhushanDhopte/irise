      Avian carriers can provide high delay, low throughput, and low altitude
      service. The connection topology is limited to a single point-to-point path
      for each carrier, used with standard carriers, but many carriers can be used
      without significant interference with each other, outside early spring. This
      is because of the 3D ether space available to the carriers, in contrast to
      the 1D ether used by IEEE802.3. The carriers have an intrinsic collision
      avoidance system, which increases availability.
